Automatic differentiation is being built into programming languages such
as Swift and Julia and added as libraries to languages to Python. This
is changing the way many optimization problems are expressed and the
sophistication with which deep learning models are being made.

This repo is an attempt to explain and understand automatic differentiation
at the conceptual level. I may choose to elaborate it later on with
algorithms for efficient implementation, but, as of this writing,
the main intention is illustration, understanding and exploration.
